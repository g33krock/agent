You'll need to install dependencies in the root, client, and server folders (sorry about that).

To run this locally, you'll need to do a build.  I've set up a command in the root folder to do the client and server builds then launch them.  That command is: npm run voltron

You'll need .env folders in the client and server folders.  For obvious reasons, those are not included here.
